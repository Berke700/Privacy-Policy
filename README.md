# Privacy Policy
TARDIS GAMES is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to all of our games and services, and it governs our data collection, processing, and usage practices. By using our games and services, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.

# Information Collection and Use
For a better user experience, our services may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information. The information requested will be retained on your device and is not collected by us in any way. However, the games do use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

# Third Party Services
Our games may include advertisements and features provided by third parties, which may collect data. We use Google Play Services and other third-party service providers, whose privacy policies can be accessed through their respective websites.

# Log Data
In case of errors in our games, we collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This may include information such as your device's IP address, device name, operating system version, configuration of the game, time and date of your usage, and other statistics.

# Cookies
Cookies are files with a small amount of data used as unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory. Our services do not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the games may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies.

# Service Providers
We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our services, provide the service on our behalf, perform service-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our service is used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

# Security
We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

# Links to Other Sites
Our services may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us, and we advise you to review their privacy policies.
